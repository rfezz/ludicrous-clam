= Externalized Configuration - Spring Boot Example Application

IMPORTANT: While you can run and interact with this example application on localhost, you cannot take advantage of using externalized configuration with this example application without using OpenShift. For more details on using this example application with a Single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://launcher.fabric8.io/docs/spring-boot-runtime.html[Spring Boot Runtime Guide].

IMPORTANT: This example application requires Java 8 JDK or greater and Maven 3.3.x or greater.

IMPORTANT: As part of the process of creating this example application using developers.redhat.com/launch or the Fabric8 Launcher tool, set up a project with a CI/CD deployment of this example application. You can see the status of this deployment in your Single-node OpenShift Cluster or OpenShift Online Web Console.

== Running the Example Application Locally
To run this example application on your local host:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:rfezz/ludicrous-clam

$ cd ludicrous-clam

$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

== Interacting with the Example Application Locally
To interact with your example application while it is running, use the form at `http://localhost:8080` or the `curl` command:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, World!"}

$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/greeting?name=Sarah
{"content":"Hello, Sarah!"}
----

== Running the Example Application on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster
If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://launcher.fabric8.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can also deploy your example application there. A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

To deploy your example application to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:

. Log in and create your project.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer

$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Be sure that view access rights for the service account are added before deploying your example application using: `oc policy add-role-to-user view -n $(oc project -q) -z default`.

. Navigate to the root directory of your application.

. Deploy your ConfigMap configuration using `application.yml`.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc create configmap app-config --from-file=application.yml
----

. Deploy your example application.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----


== Interacting with the Example Application on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster

To interact with your example application while it is running on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster, you first need to obtain its URL:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get route ${value-name-app} -o jsonpath={$.spec.host}

${value-name-app}-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME
----

You can use the form at your application's URL or you can use the `curl` command:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl http://${value-name-app}-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello World from a ConfigMap!"}

$ curl http://${value-name-app}-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/api/greeting?name=Sarah
{"content":"Hello Sarah from a ConfigMap!"}
----
